# Number Guessing Game - Clean Version

A clean and improved remake of the classic Number Guessing Game built with Python.

## Features

- Computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 20  
- User guesses until correct  
- Hints given if guess is too high or too low  
- Attempts tracked and displayed on win  
- Input validation for number range and type  
- Clear, modular code using functions  

## How to Play

2. Enter your guess (between 1 and 20)  
3. Follow hints until you guess correctly  
4. See how many attempts you took  

## Purpose

This project was created to practice Python basics such as loops, conditionals, functions, and user input validation, while focusing on clean and readable code structure.

## Usage

Clone the repo and run the script with Python 3:
